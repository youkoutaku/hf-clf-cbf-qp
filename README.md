# HF-CLF-CBF-QP

**Hierarchical Fallback CLF-CBF-QP (HF-CLF-CBF-QP)** is a control framework for **safety-critical formation tracking**.  
It combines advanced Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) with a **three-stage hierarchical fallback strategy** to ensure **safety, feasibility, and performance** in real-time applications.

## üîç Overview

- **Performance Guarantee**: Uses **Exponential Stability CLFs (ES-CLFs)** to achieve stable and high-performance tracking.  
- **Safety & Constraints**: Incorporates **High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs)** to enforce safety rules and physical limitations.  
- **Hierarchical Fallback**: Introduces a **three-stage fallback strategy** that:
  1. Prioritizes safety over performance,  
  2. Ensures feasibility when constraints conflict,  
  3. Minimizes computational cost overhead compared to traditional CLF-CBF-QP.
