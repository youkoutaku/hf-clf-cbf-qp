HF-CLF-CBF-QP(Hierarchical Fallback  CLF-CBF-QP) is a frame work for safety-critical formation tracking that uses ES-CLF for performance and HOCBFs for safety and physical limitations.  A three-stage fallback strategy guarantees controller feasibility and prioritizes safety with no significant increase in computational cost.
